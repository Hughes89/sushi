There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## A New Portfolio ##
  > Dribbble meets GitHub. A community based portfolio for web developers where employers can view a potential hireâ€™s previous work in a clean and comprehensive way.

## Summary ##
  sushi makes it really pleasant and easy to share your programming projects with anyone. 

## Problem ##
  GitHub repos are extremely functional for working on projects, but not the greatest way to display your work. 

## Solution ##
  If you want to display the end result of your efforts working on an app, show off your tech chops by letting employers know what tech you used, and let people know what you were actually in charge of, sushi is your new best friend.

## Quote from You ##
  > sushi is the best way for you to show off your work, hands down. - Dr. Jacob Goddard IV, PhD, CEO

## How to Get Started ##
  It's super easy to set up your profile, create projects and get started uploading images, defining your tech stack, linking to your GitHub repos, and defining your role on the team.

## Customer Quote ##
  > I really wanted to display my work in a clean and beautiful way to employers and my fellow engineers, and sushi gives me an easy way to do that. - Andrew Cernek
  > When hiring new engineers, it's really nice to be able to see all of their work in one place and tell what pieces of the application they were in charge of, rather than digging through their GitHub repos. - Robin Kim

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Join today and show off your work!
